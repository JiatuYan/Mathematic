# 9.11.2 Outlet
At the outlet we usually know little about the flow.
For this reason, 
  these boundaries should be
  as far downstream of the region of interest as possible.
Otherwise, errors may propagate upstream.
Usually one extrapolates along grid lines
  from the interior to the boundary (or, better, along streamlines).
The simplest approximation is that of zero gradient along grid lines.

If velocities are extrapolated to outlet boundary,
  one usually corrects them 
  -- if the flow is assumed to be incompressible
  -- so that the outflow mass flux matches the inflow mass flux.

When the flow is unsteady, 
  especially when turbulence is directly simulated,
  care is needed to avoid reflection of errors at the outlet boundary.
These issues are discussed in Sects. [[13.6 Solution Forcing| 13.6]].
