Real water waves propagate in a viscous fluid over an irregular bottom of varying permeability. A remarkable fact, however, is that in most cases the main body of the fluid motion is nearly irrotational. This is because the viscous effects are usually  concentrated in thin "boundary" layers near the surface and the bottom. Since water can also be considered reasonably incompressible, a velocity potential and a stream function should exist for waves. To simplify the mathematical analysis, numerous other assumptions must and will be made as the development of teh theory proceeds.
