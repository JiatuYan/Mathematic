By definition, a fluid is a substance distinguished from solids by  the fact that it deforms continuously under the action of shear stresses. This deformation occurs by the fluids's flowing. 

Shear stresses are caused by forces acting tangentially to a surface; they are always present in a real flowing fluid and, as [[Hydrostatic Pressure|pressures]], have the units of force per unit area.

Let we examine small volume(see Figure 2.4), we can see that there are three possible stresses for each of the six faces of the cube; two shear stresses and a normal stress, perpendicular to the face. Any other arbitrarily oriented stress can always be expressed in terms of theses three.

There are nine stresses that are exerted on the cube faces. Three of these stresses include the [[Hydrostatic Pressure| pressure]], as the normal stresses are written as
$$
\begin{align}
\sigma_{xx} &= -p + \tau_{xx},\\
\sigma_{yy} &= -p + \tau_{yy},\\
\sigma_{zz} &= -p + \tau_{zz},\\
\end{align}
$$
where 
$$
p=-(\frac{\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy} + \sigma_{zz}}{3}),
$$
for both still and flowing fluids.

By using Newton's second law adapted to moments and angular momentum, we can show that some of the shear stresses are identical
$$
\tau_{yx} = \tau_{xy},\ \tau_{xz} = \tau_{zx},\ \tau_{yz} = \tau_{zy}.
$$
Therefore, there are only six unknown stresses $(\sigma_{xx},\ \tau_{xy},\ \tau_{xz},\ \tau_{yz},\ \sigma_{yy},\ \sigma_{zz})$ on the element. These stresses depend on parameters such as fluid viscosity and fluid turbulence.
