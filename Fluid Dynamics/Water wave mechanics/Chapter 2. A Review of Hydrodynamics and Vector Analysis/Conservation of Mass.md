In a real fluid, mass must be conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed. The continuity equation is 
$$
\left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot \nabla\rho\right)
 + \rho\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u} = 0. $$
Considering the bulk modulus $E$ of the fluid, where
$$
E = \rho\frac{\mathbf{d}p}{\mathbf{d}\rho},$$
where $\mathbf{d}p$ is the incremental change in pressure, causing the compression of the fluid. Thus
$$
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\mathbf{d}p}{\mathbf{d}t} = \frac{1}{E}\frac{\mathbf{d}p}{\mathbf{d}t}.
$$
For water, $E=2.07\times 10^9\ \mathbf{Nm}^{-2}$, a very large number. For example, a $1\times 10^6\ \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$ increase in pressure results in a $0.05\%$  change in density of water.

The conservation of mass equation for an incompressible fluid can be stated simply as 
$$
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u} = 0.$$
This equation is also referred to as the continuity equation.
