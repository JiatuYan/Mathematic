The motion of a fluid particle is induced by the forces that act on the particle. These forces are of two types: [[Surface Forces| surface forces]] and [[Body Forces|body forces]].

All of these forces which act on the cube of fluid will cause it to move as predicted by Newton's second law, $\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}$, for a volume of constant mass $m$.
