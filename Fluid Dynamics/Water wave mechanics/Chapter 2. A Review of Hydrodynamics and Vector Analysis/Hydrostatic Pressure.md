For a still fluid, there are no [[Shear Stresses|shear stresses]] and the normal stresses or forces must balance each other, $\mathbf{F}=0$. Normal stresses must be present because we know that a fluid column has a weight and this weight must be supported by a pressure times the area of the column.

At a point, 
$$
p_x = p_y = p_z,$$
this means the pressure at a point is independent of direction or, in another words, the pressure is a scalar. 

Any surface immsersed in a fluid will have a force exerted on it by the hydrostatic pressure, and the force acts in the direction of the normal to the surface.

The pressure increases linearly with increasing depth into the fluid.
$$
p = -\rho\mathbf{g}z.
$$

The buoyancy force is just a result of the hydrostatic pressure acting over the surface of a body.
