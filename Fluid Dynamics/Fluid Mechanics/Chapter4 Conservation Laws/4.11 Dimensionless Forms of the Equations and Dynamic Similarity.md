For flow around an immersed body,
  like a sphere,
  we can define the (dimensionless) drag and lift coefficients,
$$
C_D\equiv \frac{F_D}{(1/2)\rho U^2 A}\ \mathrm{and}\ C_L\equiv \frac{F_L}{(1/2)\rho U^2A'},
$$
where $A$ is a reference area,
  and $F_D$ and $F_L$ are the drag and lift forces, respectively,
  experienced by the body.
For blunt bodies such as spheres and cylinders,
  $A$ is taken to be the diameter $d$,
  and $A=bd$ for a cylinder of diameter $d$ and length $b$,
  with its axis perpendicular to the flow.
