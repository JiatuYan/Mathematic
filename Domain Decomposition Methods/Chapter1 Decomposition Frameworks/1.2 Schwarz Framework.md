In this section, we describe the hybrid formulation underlying the Schwarz alternating method for a two subdomain overlapping decomposition of $\Omega$. We let $\Omega^*_1$ and $\Omega_2^*$ denote the overlapping subdomains, and let $B^{(i)}=\partial\Omega_i^*\cap\Omega$ and $B_[i]=\partial\Omega_i^*\cap\partial\Omega$ denote the interior and exterior boundary segments of $\Omega_i^*$, respectively, see [Fig 1.3](#fig:1.3)

# 1.2.1 Motivation
To derive the hybrid formulation underlying Schwarz's method, let $u(x)$ denote the solution of [[1.1 Hybrid Formulations#^598067|(1.1)]]. Denote $w_i(x)=u(x)$ on $\Omega_i^*$ for $1\leq i\leq 2$. Then, by construction $Lw_i=f$ in $\Omega_i^*$. Furthermore, the continuity of $u$ will yield matching of $w_1$ and $w_2$ on $\Omega_1^*\cap\Omega_2^*$. It will therefore hold that:
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
Lw_1=f,& \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_1^*\\
w_1=w_2,&\mathrm{on}\ B^{(1)}\\
w_1=0,&\mathrm{on}\ B_{[1]}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
Lw_2=f,& \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_2^*\\
w_2=w_1,& \mathrm{on}\ B^{(2)}\\
w_2=0,& \mathrm{on}\ B_{[2]}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\tag{*}
$$
Importantly, if the above coupled, decomposed system for $w_1(x)$ and $w_2(x)$ is **well-posed**, then by solving it, the original solution can be recovered with $u(x)=w_i(x)$ on $\Omega_i^*$ for $i=1,2$. 
**<big>Remark</big>**: The computation of [[1.1 Hybrid Formulations#^598067|(1.1)]] is decomposed into solving two coupled equations [[1.2 Schwarz Framework#^4f811c|(*)]].
**<big>Theorem 1.6</big>**: Suppose the following assumptions hold.
1. Let $c(x)\geq 0$ and $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{b}(x)\leq 0.$
2. Let $u(x)$ denote a sufficiently smooth solution of equation [[1.1 Hybrid Formulations#^598067|(1.1)]].
3. Let $w_1(x)$ and $w_2(x)$ be sufficiently smooth solutions of the following system of coupled elliptic equations:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
Lw_1=f,& \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_1^*\\
w_1=w_2,&\mathrm{on}\ B^{(1)}\\
w_1=0,&\mathrm{on}\ B_{[1]}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
Lw_2=f,& \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_2^*\\
w_2=w_1,& \mathrm{on}\ B^{(2)}\\
w_2=0,& \mathrm{on}\ B_{[2]}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\tag{1.12}
$$

Then the following result will hold:
$$
u(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
w_1(x),& \mathrm{on}\ \overline{\Omega}_1^*,\\
w_2(x),& \mathrm{on}\ \overline{\Omega}_2^*.\
\end{array}
\right.
$$
# 1.2.2 Iterative Methods
The iterative method proposed by H.A.Schwarz is a very popular method for the solution of elliptic partial differential equations. It is robustly convergent for a large class of elliptic equations, and can be motivated heuristically using the block structure of [[1.2 Schwarz Framework#^d45805|(1.12)]]. If $w_i^(k)$ denotes the k'th iterate on subdomain $\Omega_i^*$, it can be updated by solving the block equation of  [[1.2 Schwarz Framework#^d45805|(1.12)]] posed on subdomain $\Omega_i^*$ with boundary conditions $w_1=w_2$ on $B^{(1)}$ or $w_2=w_1$ on $B^{(2)}$ approximated by the current iterate on its adjacent subdomain:
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
Lw_1^{(k+1)}=f,& \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_1^*\\
w_1^{(k+1)}=w_2^{(k)},&\mathrm{on}\ B^{(1)}\\
w_1^{(k+1)}=0,&\mathrm{on}\ B_{[1]}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
Lw_2^{(k+1)}=f,& \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_2^*\\
w_2^{(k+1)}=w_1^{(k+1)},& \mathrm{on}\ B^{(2)}\\
w_2^{(k+1)}=0,& \mathrm{on}\ B_{[2]}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\tag{**}
$$
The resulting algorithm is the **Schwarz alternating method**. It is sequential in natrue and summarized below.

**<big>Algorithm 1.2.1(Schwarz Alternating Method)</big>**:
Let $v^(0)$ denote the satarting global approximate solution.
1. For k=0,1,$\cdots$, until convergence do:
	1. Solve for $w_1^{(k+1)}$ as follows:
		- $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll}Lw_1^{(k+1)}=f_1,&\mathrm{in}\ \Omega_1^*\\ w_1^{(k+1)}=v^(k),& \mathrm{on}\ B^{(1)}\\ w_1^{(k+1)}=g,&\mathrm{on}\ B_{[1]},\end{array}\right.$$
	2. Define $v^{(k+1/2)}$ as follows:
		- $$v^{(k+1/2)} \equiv \left\{\begin{array}{ll} w_1^{(k+1)},&\mathrm{in}\ \Omega_1^*\\ v^{(k)},& \mathrm{on}\ \Omega\setminus \Omega_1^*.\end{array}\right.$$
	3. Solve for $w_2^{(k+1)}$ as follows:
		-  $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll}Lw_2^{(k+1)}=f_2,&\mathrm{in}\ \Omega_2^*\\ w_2^{(k+1)}=v^(k+1/2),& \mathrm{on}\ B^{(2)}\\ w_2^{(k+1)}=g,&\mathrm{on}\ B_{[2]},\end{array}\right.$$
	4. Define $v^{(k+1)}$ as follows:
		- $$v^{(k+1)} \equiv \left\{\begin{array}{ll}w_2^{(k+1)},&\mathrm{in}\ \Omega_2^*\\ v^{(k+1/2)},& \mathrm{on}\ \Omega\setminus \Omega_2^*.\end{array}\right.$$
2. Endfor

The preceding Schwarz algorithm is sequential in nature, requiring the solution of one subdomain problem prior to another. Below, we describe an unaccelerated parallel Schwarz algorithm which requires the concurrent solution of subdomain problems. It is motivated by a popular parallel mehtod, referred to as the additive Schwarz algorithm, which is employed typically as a preconditioner. The algorithm we descrbe is based on a partition of unity $\chi_1(x)$ and $\chi_2(x)$ subordinate to the overlapping subdomains $\Omega_1^*$ and $\Omega_2^*$, respectively. Let $w_i^{(k)}$ denote the k'th iterate on $\Omega_i^*$ for $1\leq i\leq 2$. Then, new iterateds are iterates are computed as follows.

**<big>Algorithm 1.2.2(Parallel Partition of Unity Scharz Method)</big>**:
Let w_1^{(0)}, $w_2^{(0)}$ denote starting local approximate solutions.
1. For $k=0,1,\cdots,$ until convergence do:
	1.  For $i=1,2$ determine $w_i^{(k+1)}$ in parallel:
		- $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll}Lw_i^{(k+1)}=f,&\mathrm{in}\ \Omega_i^*\\ w_i^{(k+1)}=\chi_1(x)w_1^{(k)}(x) + \chi_2(x)w_2^{(k)}(x),& \mathrm{on}\ B^{(i)}\\ w_i^{(k+1)}=0,&\mathrm{on}\ B_{[i]},\end{array}\right.$$
